I am Sizhong Qin, currently a Ph.D. student in [the Department of Civil Engineering](https://www.civil.tsinghua.edu.cn/ce/) at Tsinghua University under the supervision of Professor [Xinzheng Lu](http://luxinzheng.net). I completed my undergraduate studies in the same department, with a minor in [Software Engineering](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

My research interests include intelligent design and construction of building structures, focusing on the application of cutting-edge artificial intelligence technologies such as LLM and Diffusion models in civil engineering to explore the future directions of intelligent civil engineering.

I can be reached at qsz23`at`mails.tsinghua.edu.cn, and I welcome collaboration and communication with interested colleagues.
