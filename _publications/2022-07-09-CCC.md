In precast concrete production sites for elevated roads, adjustable formwork systems are often used to accommodate the precast components of varying shapes and sizes. Therefore, it is needed to locate and adjust the formwork frequently when the elevated road adopts continuously varying cross-sections. However, the traditional way requires significant labor costs and heavy equipment, and is prone to miscalculation. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a quick location system for formwork adjustment based on a smartphone and the latest technologies including computer vision, BIM, and cloud computing. In this research, firstly, the background and existing research were investigated; then, the engineering requirements for quick location of formwork were analyzed and the system architecture was designed; next, the visual measurement and adjustment calculation modules at the back-end were implemented based on computer vision and BIM technology, and the user interface and lightweight BIM interface modules at the front-end were implemented based on HTML, jQuery, Node.js and BIMFACE; finally, the research was summarized and prospected. With the system, surveyors can compute the adjustment amount of the support at the production site with just a smartphone, which can effectively reduce measurement time and improve efficiency. In conclusion, this research provides an effective approach for supporting the quick location of concrete formwork in the production of precast components.
