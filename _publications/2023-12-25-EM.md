Efficient methods for incorporating engineering experience into the intelligent generation and optimization of shear wall structures are lacking, hindering intelligent design performance assessment and enhancement. This study introduces an assessment method used in the intelligent design and optimization of shear wall structures that effectively combines mechanical analysis and formulaic encoding of empirical rules. First, the critical information about the structure was extracted through data structuring. Second, an empirical rule assessment method was developed based on the engineer's experience and design standards to complete a preliminary assessment and screening of the structure. Subsequently, an assessment method based on mechanical performance and material consumption was used to compare different structural schemes comprehensively. Finally, the assessment effectiveness was demonstrated using a typical case. Compared to traditional assessment methods, the proposed method is more comprehensive and significantly more efficient, promoting the intelligent transformation of structural design.
