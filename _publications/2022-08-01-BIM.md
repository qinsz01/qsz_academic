Existing methods for calculating adjustable template positioning adjustment are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly. To address this issue, this study proposes a convenient calculation system for segmental beam template adjustment based on the "cloud+end" model. This system enables rapid measurement and calculation of the template adjustment amount using only a smartphone on the construction site. The study analyzed the system functions based on actual engineering needs, designed the system architecture, and developed a mobile application system utilizing cloud computing, computer vision, and a lightweight BIM platform. The advantages of this method include low cost, high efficiency, ease of use, and broad application prospects.
