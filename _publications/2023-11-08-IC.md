As one of China's key industries and economic pillars, the construction industry has long been plagued by low productivity and limited levels of automation. However, large language models present new possibilities for industry advancement. This paper proposes an application framework for large language models in construction engineering, utilizing prompt engineering and a local knowledge base to enhance model performance. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through experimental analysis, exploring its feasibility in various domains within the industry and providing detailed application examples for specific tasks. The experimental results indicate that although there is still room for improvement in tackling complex problems, large language models have already demonstrated their potential to replace certain text-related tasks in construction engineering, offering a new direction for the future development of the construction industry.
